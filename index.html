      Near H-Town there was a farmer who grew melons. H-Town nor the region and its long and storied past had ever known a melon farmer as good as she. Very few people knew her name, but over time she began to be referred to as Miss Melon. It was not long until she started to answer to this call. She was proud to be known for something. <span class="ital">I am Miss Melon.</span>

      No one quite knew when Miss Melon was born, it seemed she had always lived a twenty-minute walk away from the north gate of H-Town. The long and plain road eventually broke off into a well-trodden path that, at its end, held Miss Melon's melon patch and its adjacent dwelling. A simple single room house, it would be called a hut if not for a window and porch attached to its front. The wood that held up Miss Melon's home was a kind that was not native to the region, and its aged and simple appearance belied its solid construction. Perhaps Miss Melon, or her family, had come from somewhere else long ago and set up near H-town. Perhaps they brought the wood with them from wherever they came from.
<span class="ital">You're bringing it up again I see. I will tell you what I think then. I have grown and tasted many melons, but I have never seen a melon like this one before.</span>

      Miss Melon rarely spent time in H-Town, she had always kept to herself in her home or busy in her patch. She was friendly enough when she did appear, usually in the early mornings before market days, where she would contract a laborer with a cart to haul the latest harvest of melons into the city for sale. She always had a soft voice and, no matter what the weather, sun or sleet, she would wear several layers of thin, drab clothing to cover herself up. Not much business sense. Miss Melon was not much of a salesperson; she was more of a hidden gem before K started working for her. But she always had the most peculiar kinds of melons at strange and seemingly inappropriate times: dark and dense cube-like melons with bitter purple flesh in the summer, large yellow melons with an airy rind that tasted candy-sweet in the winter, triangular pink melons that were only five inches big with a floral aroma in the autumn, and huge golden melons that tasted of warmth and comfort in the spring.
<span class="ital">Its rind is like gossamer to the touch, its fruit sweet like ambrosia. The juice from the flesh seems to crystallize as soon as it leaves the fruit. This melon might be a miracle.</span>

      One year, K showed up in H-Town just before the start of spring with nothing but the tattered clothes on his back and a small bag full of his personal effects. A real dashing man; the few girls left in town that year really had a thing for him when he first showed up. K had just come from the south coast, the place that he had grown up had flooded and he had found his way here. He said he was excited to get to know the Great Plain better, but beneath that charming exterior you could see that he was desperately trying to get a handle on the bad cards life had dealt him. Not many refugees made it up to H-Town, so the townsfolk tried to be kind to this eccentric young man who almost always had a wide smile on his face and almost nothing to his name. A kind of nervous, almost frantic energy hid behind his friendly exterior. At least, it did, until the first market day where K met Miss Melon. From their first glances at each other, it seemed there was a strong, almost psychic connection between them; even the other stalls at the market remarked that it felt like there was a change in the air when those two first met. The two spoke in hushed tones for a while, before Miss Melon closed her stall early, paid for a long carrying stick, and set off back to her patch with K in tow, carrying the rest of her unsold melons off each end. Neither of them returned to town for several weeks, it wasn't until the first of the peach blossoms in the town-square started blossoming that they reappeared.
      <span class="ital">I am not sure that anyone should be able to taste a melon like this, the kinds of effects something like this scare me; and I might have gone through more melons than the earth has had years.</span>

      K and Miss Melon made quite the pair. When they first reappeared during market days, theirs was the first stall that had a line up before noon. K was an exceptional hawker, always haggling with the utmost charm while keeping an eye out on other fruit stalls and what they managed to scrounge up, one hand just below his breast as his other would warmly clap the shoulder of whomever he spoke to. The time with K had seemed to begin a change in Miss Melon as well. As the market size slowly started to swell in size as the year rolled on, she started to come out of her shell, and quite literally in a certain sense; for the first time Miss Melon started to expose some of her skin in public. First her arms, strong and firm from digging in the dirt and maintaining land. Then came her legs; first her ankles and by the summer she had started wearing skirts. As the months dragged on and certain deliberations between customers and K dragged further, Miss Melon would appear with a cloth full of freshly sliced melons. Usually these were from a special reserve, these melons bearing soft pink skin and deep red flesh, a long knife dangling around her legs with the bloody juice still dripping from its edge, like pomegranate seeds.
      <span class="ital">I do not want any trouble, I think you should destroy any trace of this particular crop.The people in town should not, no, no one can be trusted with a fruit this sacred.</span>

      Those years were hard, and the people of H-Town were lucky to have Miss Melon's fruits despiteworsening harvests. K's appearance too brought a new dynamic to the town. Once word started  spreading of strange fruits being grown, people started sending scouts to the city to investigate the market days. Slowly but surely the influx of people brought about a new wave  of business and growth within H-Town to accommodate the sojourning bodies. K and Miss Melon grew too, they both seemed to step into their own after meeting each other. The frantic energy that seemed to be the coal in K's furnace had been replaced with a cleaner-burning alternative, he seemed to become more rugged and handsome as winter neared. Miss Melon had her own transformation, from an abstract ghost of a farmer to a sensuous and self-effacing woman.  By the end of the year, her chest had become fuller and her face more rounded: both K and Miss Melon seemed to be cultivating and enhancing something innate within and through each other, and the townspeople were lucky to witness such a thing and share in some of its sprouts.
      <span class="ital" >If you cannot bear to get rid of this fruit, I do not blame you, but you must understand, it has already changed you. It has probably already changed me, too. I was not born here, my parents brought me here when I was very young. They died a few years after they finished this house... I can already feel my attachment to this place changing. We should leave nowbefore things change too much.</span>

      It's hard for most people to imagine what H-Town used to be like, or exactly when Miss Melon and K left. But for those who saw the change first hand and are still around, remember the smell. What I've heard is that sometime during the first few weeks of spring, when it was still cold and snowing, a new town guard noticed what seemed like a long line just underneath the horizon during their first shift patrolling the entrance from the road that led to Miss Melon's patch. They thought it strange, so they found some people in town to go and investigate. The party had apparently walked for ten minutes before they realized the "long black line" had turned into a shifting and moving one; by twelve minutes they walked by their first honeydew; by fifteen they could walk no further as the entire road and area leading up to Miss Melon's patch was teeming with melons. One of the kids of a member of that party told me one time that his mom said that she had never seen anything so fucked up, what looked like ten thousand melons of all shapes and sizes had pooled around Miss Melonâ€™s patch. Apparently they formed a kind of liquid all to themselves, the base layer slowly churned forward while the middle layer spread out further and faster to form a new base while letting in room for the top to fall through when the middle dispersed. Said she said it felt like a living thing, that she had never felt so insignificant and petty in her entire life. The party could not figure out any real way of getting to the patch, or make sense of the situation in general, so they walked back to town. They informed the mayor, who promptly asked to be taken there with the head of town guards. They walked for fourteen minutes and fifty nine seconds before being unable to go any further. After collecting themselves, they apparently walked back, and both of them quit their respective jobs and became shut-ins. Alarmed at the sudden vacancy of the two most important jobs in H-town, their respective deputies took power and immediately contacted the state government for assistance. So began a long and boring cycle of various officials in various positions at various branches or with various jurisdictions making trips for the next several weeks to Miss Melon's patch. With each trip, the time it took to walk from H-Town to the border of the melon mass grew shorter and shorter; so too followed various waves of resignations and various political repositionings. By the time spring had sprung, a  whole swath of the government on the continent was reshuffled, and the melons had officially reached H-Town. They had also started to rot. Same kid who told me his mom was there told me she got really depressed after she saw the melons, started thinking that everything she had ever done was hopeless in the grand scheme of things. If things like this were possible, what was the point living this meaningless life, shit like that. But the first few days before the rot, before people would learn what the rot was like, the smell of all those melons was another experience that would forever change her, change everyone in the town who remembered  it. That's how you can always tell, they're usually older and they're talking about real weird shit all the time to anyone who will listen. People like that all over the world now. Anyway. Apparently, the mom said she was lucky to live a life where two life-changing things could happen to her, even though both of them grew from the melons. But then the rot came, and then the bugs, the government brought in birds but they all flew away, a mess. I bet she was really busy by then. By the time the winter solstice rolled around, the continental government decided to just put a box over the patch, and H-Town had a new wave of baby births around that time too. The city had grown to facilitate teams and organizations moving and hauling melons away from H-Town and towards other cities and networks in the area. This network was generated spontaneously as a temporary measure of reducing the sheer volume of melons in the region, and few people at the time would say no to free fruit. A specially trained team of scholars was sent to source to document and catalog each and every kind of melon, but all of them gave up after a few weeks. I think all of them were driven crazy by trying to make sense of it. Some of them even went on to kill people. Fucked up shit. So that's why people come to H-Town, to hear the story about Miss Melon and K and how the government built a big melon dispensing box.  Saved you a fifteen dollar museum tour fee, care to spare some change?

      <span class="ital">It's silly. I know we're about to leave, but do you know what my favourite thing about being here is? It only happens in the winter, when it's nice and cold outside and there's a strong wind. When the window gets let open just a little bit, on those nights... the moisture from my body, from our bodies wicks away and becomes part of the atmosphere, becomes part of the room. Tiny parts of us collect along the window and mix with the outside world and freeze, forming icy crystals and, if it's cold enough, could eventually seal the opening all together. The feeling of the cool temperature radiating down from the top and the warmth that builds from the bed, and a mix of our selves and the world build up and form into structures that could close us off all together. It feels comforting and also very sad... I'm ready for change.</span>
